This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

It is driven by 1536 bits of entropy, stored in an array of\n\t48, 32-bit JavaScript variables.  Since many applications of this generator,\n\tincluding ours with the \"Off The Grid\" Latin Square generator, may require\n\tthe deteriministic re-generation of a sequence of PRNs, this PRNG's initial\n\tentropic state can be read and written as a static whole, and incrementally\n\tevolved by pouring new source entropy into the generator's internal state.\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tENDLESS THANKS are due Johannes Baagoe for his careful development of highly\n\trobust JavaScript implementations of JS PRNGs.  This work was based upon his\n\tJavaScript \"Alea\" PRNG which is based upon the extremely robust Multiply-\n\tWith-Carry (MWC) PRNG invented by George Marsaglia.

It handily passes the fermilab.ch tests as\n\twell as the \"diehard\" and \"dieharder\" test suites.  For individuals wishing\n\tto further verify the quality of this algorithm's pseudo-random numbers, a\n\t256-megabyte file of this algorithm's output may be downloaded from GRC.com,\n\tand a Microsoft Windows scripting host (WSH) version of this algorithm may be\n\tdownloaded and run from the Windows command prompt to generate unique files\n\tof any size:\n\tThe Fermilab \"ENT\" tests: http://fourmilab.ch/random/\n\tThe 256-megabyte sample PRN file at GRC: https://www.GRC.com/otg/uheprng.bin\n\tThe Windows scripting host version: https://www.GRC.com/otg/wsh-uheprng.js\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tQualifying MWC multipliers are: 187884, 686118, 898134, 1104375, 1250205,\n\t1460910 and 1768863.
